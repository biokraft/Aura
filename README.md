Aura is a firmware for a DIY smart weather widget that runs on ESP32-2432S028R devices, commonly known as "Cheap Yellow Displays" (CYDs). It features a 2.8" touchscreen display, providing a rich, graphical interface for viewing current weather conditions, 7-day forecasts, and hourly outlooks.

This repository contains the complete source code and a detailed guide for building and installing the Aura firmware. The beautiful 3D-printable case was designed by [Surrey-Homeware/Aura](https://github.com/Surrey-Homeware/Aura), and you can find the design and assembly instructions on [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1382304-aura-smart-weather-forecast-display).

## ✨ Features

-   🌡️ **Current Weather:** Displays temperature, "feels like" temperature, and a large, dynamic weather image.
-   📅 **7-Day Forecast:** Shows the upcoming week's weather with high/low temperatures and icons.
-   🕒 **Hourly Forecast:** Provides a 7-hour outlook with temperature, precipitation probability, and icons.
-   🌍 **Location Search:** Find and set any location worldwide.
-   🌐 **Multi-Lingual Support:** UI available in English, Spanish, German, and French.
-   👆 **Touch-Enabled Interface:** Easily navigate between views and settings.
-   ⚙️ **Configurable Settings:** Adjust brightness, temperature units (°C/°F), and time format (12/24hr).

## 🔩 Hardware Requirements

-   **Device:** ESP32-2432S028R (also known as a "CYD" or Cheap Yellow Display)
-   **Display:** 2.8" 240x320 ILI9341 TFT Display
-   **Touch Controller:** XPT2046
-   **Cable:** Micro-USB data cable
-   **Computer:** Windows, macOS, or Linux computer for flashing

## 🚀 Quick Start Installation

This method uses a `Makefile` to automate the entire setup and installation process.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Git:** [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **Make:**
    - **macOS:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
    - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
    - **Windows:** Use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (`choco install make`) or install it with Git Bash.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanbaufeld/Aura.git
cd Aura
```

### 2. Install and Flash

Connect your ESP32 device to your computer via USB and run:

```bash
make install
```

This single command will:
- ✅ Install Arduino CLI
- ✅ Install ESP32 board support
- ✅ Install all required libraries
- ✅ Configure library settings automatically
- ✅ Compile and flash the firmware
- ✅ Provide detailed progress updates

**Supported Platforms:** macOS, Linux, Windows (with WSL or Git Bash).

If you encounter any issues, please see the [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). For a fully manual installation process, refer to the [Manual Installation Guide](./docs/MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md).

## 📲 Device Setup

After successfully flashing the firmware, your device needs initial WiFi configuration:

1.  **Power On:** Connect the device to a power source.
2.  **Connect to "Aura" Network:** On your phone or computer, connect to the WiFi network named **"Aura"**. No password is required.
3.  **Configure WiFi:** A configuration portal should open automatically. If not, open a browser and go to `http://192.168.4.1`.
4.  **Save Credentials:** Select your home WiFi network, enter the password, and click **Save**.
5.  **Restart:** The device will restart and connect to your network.

Once connected, you can set your location and customize settings by long-pressing the screen.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

For developers looking to contribute to the project, a detailed guide covering environment setup, code quality tools, and the complete list of `Makefile` commands is available in the [**Developer Guide**](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
